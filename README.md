# Portfolio by Ester Van de Put: Master's Degree Showcase

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio, a curated collection of projects from my Master's degree. This portfolio highlights my journey through complex data analysis, machine learning, and programming challenges. Each project demonstrates my ability to apply advanced statistical techniques to address real-world problems, reflecting my skills as a marketing/data analyst.

## Portfolio Overview
Explore a range of projects that showcase data-driven insights and intricate machine-learning models. My portfolio demonstrates how I use analytics to solve business questions and drive informed decision-making.

## Featured Project

### 1. Wedding Industry in the Bay Area
#### Course: Business Analysis with Structured Data
In this course, students analyze complex business scenarios and create data models using SQL.

#### Project Description
The "Wedding Industry in the Bay Area" project explores the competitive wedding services market, focusing on the relationship between price and customer satisfaction. The data analysis uses SQL and Python to uncover insights that help understand the factors driving customer satisfaction.

- **SQL Queries**: Developed a dataset by writing SQL queries to explore, analyze, and prepare the data.
- **Python Analysis**: Applied Python to generate descriptive statistics, frequency tables, correlations, and various data visualizations, such as scatterplots and boxplots.
- **Business Insights**: Determined that price does not show a clear correlation with customer satisfaction, indicating that other factors might play a more significant role.

NOTE: to view the code correctly with its visualizations, download the raw file as an HTML document. This ensures the visual content displays as intended.

#### Requirements for this Project
- **SQL**:
  - Developed queries to explore and prepare data for analysis.
  - Included ample comments to explain the logic.
  - Followed best practices to create a final dataset.
  
- **Python**:
  - Created descriptive statistics, frequency tables, correlations, and multiple data visualizations.
  - Ensured that only relevant data was presented, avoiding data dumping.

This project exemplifies my ability to work with complex data, apply advanced analytical techniques, and derive meaningful insights for stakeholders.
