## Featured Project

### 1. Wedding Industry in the Bay Area
#### Course: Business Analysis with Structured Data
This course taught me how to  analyze complex business scenarios and create data models using SQL.

#### Project Description
The "Wedding Industry in the Bay Area" project explores the competitive wedding services market, focusing on the relationship between price and customer satisfaction. The data analysis uses SQL and Python to uncover insights that help understand the factors driving customer satisfaction.

- **SQL Queries**: Developed a dataset by writing SQL queries to explore, analyze, and prepare the data. (see file 1.1)
- **Python Analysis**: Applied Python to generate descriptive statistics, frequency tables, correlations, and various data visualizations, such as scatterplots and boxplots. 
- **Business Insights**: Determined that price does not show a clear correlation with customer satisfaction, indicating that other factors might play a more significant role. 

#### Skills and Tools Learned
Through this project, I developed and honed the following skills and tools:

- **SQL Proficiency**: Ability to write complex SQL queries to create datasets.
- **Python Programming**: Application of Python to conduct statistical analysis and create visualizations.
- **Analytical Thinking**: Using data to derive business insights and understand underlying patterns.

### 2. Text Adventure Game: THE HUNGER GAMES
#### Course: Python for Data Analysts
In this course, I learned to drive meaning from large datasets using Python and apply statistical methods. I also learn new programming design principles.

#### Project Requirements
The assignment's goal was to create a text-based adventure game using Python's fundamental concepts and programming design principles. The key requirements included:

- A game script that could be completed in under 3 minutes.
- At least 3 stages with no more than 5 stages in total.
- A minimum of 5 defined variables, 1 list, 1 for loop, and 1 while loop.
- 3 nested conditional statements, each with an else clause.
- A win() function and a fail() function to indicate game outcomes.
- A brief introduction to the game's story and objective.

#### Skills and Tools Learned
Through this project, I developed and honed the following skills and tools:

- **Python Programming**: Deepened my understanding of Python essentials, including strings, functions, conditionals, and loops.
- **Error Handling**: Learned to use try/except blocks for robust input handling.
- **Game Design**: Developed a structured text-based adventure game, focusing on script flow and user interaction.
- **Problem-solving**: Applied logical reasoning to design game stages and scenarios.

### 3. Preparing Client Proposals
#### Course: Data Analytics for Business Solutions
This course taught me how to analyze business scenarios to generate effective client proposals through SQL and Python. It also furthered my knowledge in structured data analysis to create insights for business planning.

#### Assignment Goal: Client Proposal Development
This assignment aimed to help clients prepare wedding options based on their estimated guest count and budget level. To accomplish this, the following steps were taken:

- **Data Preparation in SQL**:
  - Created a temporary table of all vendors fitting the wedding theme, naming it `relevant_vendors`.
  - We have added new categorical attributes for `wedding_size` and `budget_level`, defining ranges based on the provided criteria.
  - Created a second temporary table, `vendor_options`, with one wedding option for each budget level and wedding size combination.
  - Included an estimated total cost in USD and the theme of the wedding for each wedding option.

#### Skills and Tools Learned
Through this project, I developed and honed the following skills and tools:

- **SQL Proficiency**: Learned to write complex SQL queries to create datasets and manipulate data, demonstrating data extraction and preparation skills.
- **Data Categorization**: Developed categorical attributes for vendors based on logical ranges and business criteria, showcasing my ability to classify and structure data.
- **Business Analysis**: Gained insights into business requirements to create effective proposals, highlighting my ability to understand client needs and offer tailored solutions.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized SQL queries to generate visualizations that aid in client presentations, indicating my skill in presenting data in a comprehensible format.
- **Problem-Solving**: Addressed client requirements through SQL tasks and SQL-derived insights, proving my capability to solve business problems with data-driven approaches.

### 4. Data Analyst at the World Bank
#### Course: Visualizing and Analyzing data with R 
In this course, I use R programming and PowerBI to create visualizations and analyze data for real-world applications.

### Assignment Goal: Create Scatterplots and Provide Insights
I played a data analyst role at the World Bank in this assignment. The goal was to produce scatterplots depicting Life Expectancy (Y-axis) and Fertility Rate (X-axis) statistics by country for the years 1960 and 2020. The scatterplots needed to be categorized by the countries' regions.

### Data and Tasks
- **Data Sources**: Data for both years was provided in a CSV file, and some additional data was provided in R vectors.
- **Scatterplots**: You created scatterplots for each year (1960 and 2020) using Life Expectancy and Fertility Rate as variables.
- **Categorization**: The scatterplots were categorized by the regions of the countries.


### Skills and Tools Learned
Through this project, I developed the following skills:

- **R Programming**: Learned to use R for data analysis and visualization.
- **Data Visualization**: Created scatterplots to represent complex data.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed and compared data from 1960 and 2020 to draw insights.
- **Statistical Insights**: Provided analysis as a data analyst to describe trends and patterns.
